  \begin{abstract}
%   The focus of this work deals with the nature of low-lying excitations in well-deformed nuclei. Historically, these states have been a veritable enigma in understanding the specific structure effects that manifest in the nucleus. The dynamic oscillations of various order (quadrupole, octupole, etc) 

One of the many paradigms of nuclear structure involves the coupling of dynamic quadrupole, octupole \& hexadecapole vibrations superimposed on top of a well-deformed ground state. Historically, the nature and feasability of collective vibrational degrees of freedom in deformed nuclei have garnered significant skepticism and experimental/theoretical interest, yet the entire rare-earth region lacked the completeness and richness of data to fully understand the systematic behavior of these low-lying excitations. Successful interpretation of quadrupole and octupole vibrational phonon states hinges upon measurement of E0 transition strengths, two-nucleon transfer reaction cross sections, and absolute transition probabilities, the latter equating to precision lifetime measurements of excited states. We have measured 29 new lifetimes in $^{160}$Gd and 47 new lifetimes in $^{162}$Dy below 3.1~MeV excitation energy, including many potentially key vibrational phonon states at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory using the Doppler Shift Attenuation Method via Inelastic Neutron Scattering (DSAM-INS). This work discusses our experimental observations in terms of the various collective multiphonon configurations in two rare-earth nuclei, $^{160}$Gd and $^{162}$Dy, with a first-of-its-kind measurement of 2 flavors of the two-phonon quadrupole vibrations, a K$^\pi$=0$^+$ $\gamma\gamma$-type and a  K$^\pi$=4$^+$ $\gamma\gamma$-type in $^{162}$Dy. This work is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant numbers PHY-1068192, PHY-1205412, and PHY-0956310.

% Historically, low-lying excitations in deformed nuclei have presented unique challenges in the context of nuclear structure. Early formulations of a geometric model surmise that quadrupole and octupole surface shape vibrations can be superimposed on top of a pre-existing prolately deformed nucleus. As the experimental evidence trickles in, this idea of strongly collective behavior becomes obscured for a multitude of reasons. Successful interpretation of the feasability of quadrupole vibrations hinges on the extraction of transition probabilities between nuclear states, which can be determined via the measurement of level lifetimes. Femtosecond to picosecond range nuclear lifetimes can be measured with the Doppler Shift Attenuation Method via Inelastic Neutron Scattering at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory, where we have performed a series of measurements of nuclear lifetimes in two rare-earth nuclei, $^{160}$Gd and $^{162}$Dy. This work discusses the lifetime measurements made, analysis techniques implemented, and nuclear structure as it pertains to single- and multi-phonon configurations of the previously mentioned deformed nuclei.

%    This thesis would be an absolute train-wreck without Ani Aprahamian, my academic advisor and mentor, for giving me the swift kick I needed at periodic times to push me through the revolving door that is graduate school, and for frequently reminding me that ``If what you were doing was easy, someone would have already done it long ago". 
%     
%   Next, I want to thank below-freezing temperatures, without you, I would have stuck around the South Bend/Notre Dame area for a few more years.
%   
%   I am forever indebted to Jacee Rohlck, for reminding me on numerous occasions that she will eternally love me (read: put up with me), no matter the circumstances.
%   
%   Although I always pay in a strict monetary sense, I owe Starbucks some degree of success, for supplying me with a near limitless amount of coffee (a necessary tool for good work) throughout graduate school.
%   
%   I need to acknowledge the best friends I have ever made in my entire life (my fellow graduate students), for keeping me sane and sufficiently distracted throughout my career here at Notre Dame.
%   
%   I would not be writing this work without the help of Dr. Richard Prior, since he convinced me it was a good idea to come to TUNL with him in 2010, effectively bringing me to the event horizon of the black hole that is experimental nuclear physics research.
%   
%   I owe thanks to Shelly Lesher, for providing me with the answers to numerous questions about the analysis process and for her gracious use of publication data for part of the results presented in this work ($^{160}$Gd excitation functions and level lifetimes below 2.0~MeV excitation energy).
%   
%   Along the same lines, I thank Ben Crider, Erin Peters, and the entire cadre of nuclear scientists at the University of Kentucky, for answering my inane, incessant, and frankly, unintelligent questions about nuclear physics and the analysis methods I would need to implement to complete the Herculean task of understanding nuclear structure.
% 
%   Lastly, I am eternally grateful for Mark Caprio's LevelScheme/SciDraw package for Mathematica for the creation of many (read: the majority) figures presented herein. Without this lifesaving program, I would never have been able to express my results in a clean and understandable fashion.
